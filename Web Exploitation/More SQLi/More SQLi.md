# Solution
I first tried the common admin admin for both username and password and got this output:

Take note that the password comes first in the query followed by the username. From here I tried the common SQL injection query:

`' OR 1=1 --` for the password and `admin` for the username again. The `--` makes the rest of the code irrelevant) Here' the output:

From here we can see there are three total columns to deal with. I then tried this query to see what would happen: 

`' UNION SELECT null,null,null;--`:

I then used the hint of using SQLite, so I tried this query using SQLite as sqlite_master is an internal table in all SQLite databases:

`' UNION SELECT sql,null,null FROM sqlite_master;--`

Here we can see that the flag is in the more_table, so I changed the one column in the query to flag and got the flag output:

`' UNION SELECT null,null,flag FROM more_table;--`
