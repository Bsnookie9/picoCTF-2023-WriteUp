# Description
BookShelf Pico, my premium online book-reading service.
I believe that my website is super secure. I challenge you to prove me wrong by reading the 'Flag' book!

Here are the credentials to get you started:
* Username: "user"
* Password: "user"

# Hints
* Maybe try to find the JWT Signing Key ("secret key") in the source code? Maybe it's hardcoded somewhere? Or maybe try to crack it?
* The 'role' and 'userId' fields in the JWT can be of interest to you!
* The 'controllers', 'services' and 'security' java packages in the given source code might need your attention. We've provided a README.md file that contains some documentation.
* Upgrade your 'role' with the new (cracked) JWT. And re-login for the new role to get reflected in browser's localStorage.

# Solution
I wasn't able to complete this without reading a write-up from someone else. I refered to [this write-up](https://brandon-t-elliott.github.io/java-code-analysis).
