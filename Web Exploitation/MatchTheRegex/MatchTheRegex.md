How about trying to match a regular expression
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

# Hints
Access the webpage and try to match the regular expression associated with the text field

# Solution
The first inital step is to look at the source code. You can do this by pressing `F12`, then opening the `<script>` part of the `<body>`.

Here we can see a comment in the code that gives a strong hint into what the input is looking for: `^p.....F!?`.

Based on the challenge, trying `picoCTF` (case sensitive) works just fine. `picoCTF!` and `picoCTF!?` also output the same flag.
